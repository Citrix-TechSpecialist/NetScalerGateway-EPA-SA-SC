# Introduction

This session will focus on Security at the edge with NetScaler ADC for XA/XD environment. You will gain hands on experience on how to trigger End Point Analysis Scans (EPA) on the NS to enforce strong security posture at the perimeter prior to Gateway logon. You will also gain insight on how to enforce security over XA/XD sessions using Smart Access and Smart Control.

# Pre-requisites

One will need an environment with NetScaler Gateway and the ability to launch a session. I am using the SD-WAN environment for the moment. SmartAccess is supported in NetScaler 8.0. 
SmartControl requires NetScaler Gateway 11.0.65.x or higher.
