~8 min to complete and to test end user experience, given a working environment where one can log in and launch a session, and administer.

Logon without it configured see your Branch VDA Desktops available.

Set up Smart Access to filter on delivery groups to hide Branch VDA Desktop if youâ€™re logging in via GW with bound session policy and observe the hidden Branch VDA desktop.
